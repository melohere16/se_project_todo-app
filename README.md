Description:
This project is a to-do list web application built using JavaScript classes and modules. Users can add, check off, and delete tasks. The application features form validation with live feedback, ensuring tasks are correctly entered before submission.

Key features include:

Object-Oriented Design: Uses Todo and FormValidator classes to organize code.

Dynamic Todo Management: Add new todos with unique IDs, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks.

Form Validation: Prevents invalid input, highlights errors, and disables the submit button until inputs are valid.

Module-Based Structure: Organized using ES6 modules for components (Todo.js, FormValidator.js) and utilities (constants.js).

Persistent & Scalable: Designed to be easily extended with additional features like due dates, categories, or storage.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), GitHub Pages for deployment.
